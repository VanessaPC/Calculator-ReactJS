# Calculator React JS 

 For the moment it contains the basic files of the project. 

## Structure: 
  * public
    * favicon
    * index.html
    * manifest.json
  * src 
    * App.css
    * App.js
    * App.test.js
    * index.css
    * index.js
    * logo.svg
    * registerServiceWorkers
  * package.json
  * README.md
  * yarn.lock

The project is incomplete, and what should come next is  all the styling, plus possibly history addition and display of the interaction of the user.
